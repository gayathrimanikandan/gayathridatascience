# Web Scraping using SELENIUM 

When we try to scrape websites with Beautifulsoup we sometimes doesnt get any HTML response. So this project helps in overcoming the issues we face using static scraping method in this case we have to use Synamic web scraping. I have used Selenium package using python language to implement it.
